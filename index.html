      <h2>My Journey in Tech</h2>
        <p><strong>From Sci-Fi Enthusiast to Self-Taught Technologist: My Journey into the Digital World</strong></p>
        <p>As a child, I was captivated by the futuristic worlds of sci-fi movies. The idea of manipulating vast amounts of data, building intelligent systems, and crafting digital solutions fascinated me. I saw myself in those tech-savvy characters—problem solvers who could shape the future with their skills. That vision stayed with me.</p>
        <p>Originally, my dream was to study aviation and become a pilot, but financial constraints, limited scholarship opportunities and lack of full information made it an unattainable goal. However, I had always believed that technology was the ultimate equalizer—a field where skill, determination, and self-learning could outweigh formal credentials. If I couldn’t take to the skies, I would take on the digital frontier.</p>

        <p><strong>From Education Admin to Tech Innovator</strong></p>
        <p>My professional journey began in the education sector, where I served as an Education Assistant in ICT at Sitoromo Primary School. In this role, I quickly became a key player in integrating technology into classrooms, optimizing learning management systems (LMS), and ensuring the effective utilization of ICT resources. I took ownership of data management, IT troubleshooting, and system audits, ensuring that educators and students had the digital tools they needed to thrive.</p>
        <p>This experience not only sharpened my technical problem-solving skills but also helped me develop business acumen, allowing me to bridge the gap between technology and operational efficiency. It was here that I realized the immense potential of programming—how a few lines of code could automate tasks, optimize workflows, and solve real-world challenges.</p>

        <p><strong>Becoming a Self-Taught Programmer</strong></p>
        <p>Determined to dive deeper into the tech world, I embarked on an intensive self-learning journey. Since formal education was not an option, I turned to free and open-source resources, enrolling in rigorous online programs that helped me develop my skills in software engineering, web development, and data analysis.</p>
        <p>I achieved several key certifications that solidified my expertise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer (2024)</strong><br>Developed a strong foundation in Python, focusing on scripting, automation, and data structures. Built real-world applications, optimizing workflows and improving system efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Development (SheCodes, 2024)</strong><br>Mastered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to create responsive, interactive web applications. Gained exposure to front-end and back-end technologies, strengthening my software engineering skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis (Ingressive for Good, 2024)</strong><br>Developed intermediate SQL skills, allowing me to manage databases, extract insights, and drive data-driven decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence in 4IR (University of Johannesburg, 2022)</strong><br>Explored AI applications, automation, and machine learning concepts, preparing for the future of intelligent systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beyond structured courses, I spent countless hours experimenting with open-source projects, coding challenges, I became proficient in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Programming & Software Development</strong><br>Python, JavaScript, SQL – Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Web Development – Building dynamic applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks. Version Control (Git, GitHub) – Collaborating on projects and maintaining clean code repositories. Automation & Scripting – Writing scripts to streamline workflows and improve system efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Support & IT Management</strong><br>IT Troubleshooting – Diagnosing and resolving software, hardware, and network issues. Learning Management Systems (LMS) & SA-SAMS – Managing educational databases and school administration systems.</li>
        </ul>
